### How I'll scale it
Based on the frontend codebase (React + Vite with Material-UI, real-time Socket.IO updates, and multi-tenant dashboard), here's how I'd scale it: I'd implement code splitting and lazy loading for routes and heavy components to reduce initial bundle size, then set up a CDN (like Cloudflare or Vercel) to serve static assets globally with edge caching. I'd optimize the Socket.IO connections by implementing connection pooling and reconnection strategies to handle network issues gracefully. For state management, I'd add proper caching strategies (React Query or SWR) to minimize API calls and implement optimistic updates for better UX. I'd also add service workers for offline support and faster subsequent loads. The quick wins I'd prioritize are: memoizing expensive components with React.memo, debouncing real-time updates to prevent UI thrashing, implementing virtual scrolling for large data lists, and setting up proper error boundaries. I'd also optimize the build process with tree-shaking and move tenant-specific theming to CSS variables for instant theme switching without re-renders.
